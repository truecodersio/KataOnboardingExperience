# Onboarding Experience

Exercise your C# skills

## Introduction

Welcome to your continued introduction to programming in this course! We're excited you're here. In this course, we're going to use C# to build an app that talks to you.

Let's say you're tasked with the onboarding experience of an app; let's say it's a banking app. It needs to grab relevant user information while making it fun and simple for the user. You decide to build the onboarding experience using a Console Application that requests user info and stores that info as the user provides it.

## Objectives

Our goals in this challenge is to:

* Interact with a C# project; specifically a console application
* Interact with many different value types and some reference types
* Practice creating an app with the user experience in mind

## App Requirements

Let's build an app that does just that. We'll need our app to grab:

* First and Last Name
* Is Account Owner
* Login Pin Number
* Store in User Class

...All while interacting with the user, storing values that your user passes to you, and communicating successful entry (think `Console.WriteLine()`)

## Challenge

We've talked about different data types. We've shown you how to view documentation. We've demonstrated how to build this application. Now, it's your turn:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Create an `onboarding` branch to accomplish your work (`git checkout -b onboarding`)
3. Build the functionality, making commits along the way
4. Push your changes (`git push`)
5. Create a pull request and add request a review from your instructor

**Bonus points:** Error validation and storing more values with the user
